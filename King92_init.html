Since the day you thought that the Lord has decided to bring you to his side, you have devoted yourself to achieving progress in the Congress of the American people. As you saw the cogs of government firsthand and the corruption seeping through the carcass of the American experiment, you saw it as your mission to break on through. The struggles in government never stopped. As you reach a decade of Reaganism, you feel like you are pushing against an immovable wall as the party of Lincoln is determined to undermine any and all progress in the land.<br><br>You've never faltered, but as Congress is proving incapable against conservative presidents, maybe you could be the one to slay the dragon? A black man, a socialist, a civil rights activist. It may not be what America wants, but maybe it is what America needs more than ever.</p>",
